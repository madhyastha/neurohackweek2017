## Summary

These exercises are intended just to get you familiar with the AWS
console and launching EC2 instances. However, there is much that we
haven't covered. You will probably need to start clusters and copy
data to and from the machine. We will discuss how to do that during
Neurohackweek and you will have ample time practice with less
restrictive credentials!
